          \ and Larry David Duhamel, an advertising salesman. His parents divorced\
          \ during his youth, and although he remains close to both, he grew up with\
          \ his mother and his three younger sisters, Ashlee, Mckenzee and Kassidy.\
          \ Duhamel attended Minot State University and played as the back-up quarterback\
          \ for the university's football team. He planned to attend dental school\
          \ but dropped out one-and-a-half credits shy of his undergraduate degree.\
          \  Duhamel has stated, \\\"After college, I followed an ex-girlfriend to\
          \ northern California, did a bunch of odd jobs.\\\" Duhamel had won the\
          \ title of Male Model of the Year in an International Modeling and Talent\
          \ Association (IMTA) competition in 1997 (the first runner-up was actor\
          \ Ashton Kutcher).  Duhamel began his acting career as an extra in the music\
          \ videos for Donna Summer's song, \\\"I Will Go With You (Con te partir\xF2\
          )\\\" in 1998 and Christina Aguilera's song, \\\"What a Girl Wants\\\" in\
          \ 1999. Later that year, he won the role of Leo du Pres on the ABC soap\
          \ opera All My Children. His work on the show, especially his character's\
          \ pairing with Greenlee Smythe (portrayed by actor Rebecca Budig), garnered\
          \ critical acclaim. In 2000, he posed fully nude for Greg Gorman's \\\"\
          As I See It\\\" photography book. In 2003, he earned a Daytime Emmy Award\
          \ nomination for the Special Fan Award for America's Favorite Couple in\
          \ 2002, shared with Budig, and a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting\
          \ Actor for his portrayal of Leo du Pres. Duhamel opted to leave All My\
          \ Children in 2002 to pursue other acting opportunities.  In 2003, Duhamel\
          \ landed a prime time role on the NBC show Las Vegas, playing the head of\
          \ security as Danny McCoy for the Montecito Casino. He succeeded James Caan\
          \ as president of the Montecito after Caan departed at the end of the fourth\
          \ season. The series was cancelled in 2008.  Duhamel made his big-screen\
          \ acting debut in 2004's Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! and continued on\
          \ to star in the thriller Turistas (2006). After watching an episode of\
          \ Las Vegas in which Duhamel's character had just returned from the war\
          \ in Iraq, Steven Spielberg handpicked him for the role of Captain William\
          \ Lennox in 2007's summer blockbuster film Transformers (a film for which\
          \ Spielberg was the executive producer). Duhamel reprised the role for the\
          \ sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, released in June 2009, and\
          \ again in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, due for release in July 2011.\
          \  Duhamel was the official pace car driver for the 2009 Indianapolis 500\
          \ driving the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car.  Duhamel will star alongside\
          \ Samuel L. Jackson in the Boaz Yakin thriller film Sympathy for the Devil.\
          \ He also appeared in The Romantics in 2010, alongside Katie Holmes, Adam\
          \ Brody, and Australian actress Annabel-Jane Brooks.  Personal life  Duhamel\
          \ met and began dating Stacy Ferguson (best known by her stage name of \\\
          \"Fergie\\\") in September 2004. Ferguson, a singer for the hip hop group\
          \ The Black Eyed Peas, appeared on Duhamel's show Las Vegas with her band\
          \ in an episode titled \\\"Montecito Lancers\\\" (which aired on November\
          \ 1, 2004). The couple wed on January 10, 2009, in the Roman Catholic ceremony\
          \ at the Church Estates Vineyards in Malibu, California. On January 10,\
          \ 2010, the couple renewed their wedding vows on a beach in Santa Barbara.\
          \ Duhamel and Ferguson reside in Brentwood, California, in a house that\
          \ they purchased together in 2007. In 2005, Duhamel became the co-owner\
          \ of 10 North Main, a restaurant located in the downtown section of Minot,\
          \ North Dakota, which features dishes such as elk and pheasant.  On December\
